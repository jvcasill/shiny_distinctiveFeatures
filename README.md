Spanish Allophones
==================

This shiny app takes a data frame of Spanish segments and 
allows the user to subset the data frame using distinctive 
features. The output is the subsetted list of segments that 
correspond with the selected features, as well as the descriptions 
of the features used. 

The app is based on the table by Casillas and Bessett (2013) 
published in the textbook 'Fonología generativa contemporánea 
de la lengua española' edited by Cedeño, R. A. N., Colina, S., & 
Bradley, T. G.
