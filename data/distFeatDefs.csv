class,NA,syllabic,"Syllabic segments may function as the nucleus of a syllable, while their counterparts, the [-syllabic] segments, may not."
class,NA,consonantal,"Consonantal segments are produced with an audible constriction in the vocal tract, such as obstruents, nasals, liquids, and trills. Vowels, glides and laryngeal segments are not consonantal."
class,NA,approximant,"Approximant segments include vowels, glides, and liquids while excluding nasals and obstruents."
class,NA,sonorant,"This feature describes the type of oral constriction that can occur in the vocal tract. [+son] designates the vowels and sonorant consonants (namely glides, liquids, and nasals), that are produced without an imbalance of air pressure in the vocal tract that might cause turbulence. [-son] describes the obstruents, articulated with a noticeable turbulence caused by an imbalance of air pressure in the vocal tract."
class,NA,resonant,is it something
laryngeal,NA,voice,This feature indicates whether vibration of the vocal folds occurs with the articulation of the segment.
laryngeal,NA,spreadGlottis,"Used to indicate the aspiration of a segment, this feature denotes the openness of the glottis. For [+sg], the vocal folds are spread apart widely enough for frication to occur; for [-sg], there is not the same friction-inducing spreading."
laryngeal,NA,constrictedGlottis,"The constricted glottis features denotes the degree of closure of the glottis. [+cg] implies that the vocal folds are held closely together, enough so that air cannot pass through momentarily, while [-cg] implies the opposite."
manner,NA,continuant,"This feature describes the passage of air through the vocal tract. [+cont] segments are produced without any significant obstruction in the tract, allowing air to pass through in a continuous stream. [-cont] segments, on the other hand, have such an obstruction, and so occlude the air flow at some point of articulation."
manner,NA,nasal,"This feature describes the position of the velum. [+nas] segments are produced by lowering the velum so that air can pass through the nasal tract. [-nas] segments conversely are produced with a raised velum, blocking the passage of air to the nasal tract and shunting it to the oral tract."
manner,NA,strident,The strident feature applies to obstruents only and refers to a type of friction that is noisier than usual. This is caused by high energy white noise.
manner,NA,lateral,"This feature designates the shape and positioning of the tongue with respect to the oral tract. [+lat] segments are produced as the center of the tongue rises to contact the roof of the mouth, thereby blocking air from flowing centrally through the oral tract and instead forcing more lateral flow along the lowered side(s) of the tongue."
manner,NA,delayedRel,This feature distinguishes stops from affricates. Affricates are designated [+del rel]
place,labial,labial," Labial segments are articulated with the lips. As consonants, these include bilabial and labiodental consonants."
place,labial,round,"[+round] are produced with lip rounding, while [-round] are not."
place,coronal,coronal,"Coronal sounds are articulated with the tip and/or blade of the tongue. These include a large number of consonants, which can be made with the tip, blade or underside of the tongue (apical, laminal, or subapical consonant, respectively), making contact with the upper lip (linguolabial), between the teeth (interdental), with the back of the teeth (dental), with the alveolar ridge (alveolar), behind the alveolar ridge (postalveolar), or on or in front of the hard palate ((pre)palatal). With postalveolar sibilants, additional tongue shapes need to be distinguished, i.e. ""domed"" or slightly palatalized (""hushing"" or ""palato-alveolar""), palatalized (alveolopalatal), and ""closed"" (""hissing-hushing"")."
place,coronal,anterior,Anterior segments are articulated with the tip or blade of the tongue at or in front of the alveolar ridge.
place,coronal,distributed,For [+dist] segments the tongue is extended for some distance in the mouth.
place,dorsal,dorsal,"Dorsal sounds are articulated by raising the dorsum of the tongue. All vowels are dorsal sounds. Dorsal consonants include palatal, velar and uvular consonants."
place,dorsal,high,[+high] segments raise the dorsum close to the palate. [-high] segments do not.
place,dorsal,low,[+low] segments bunch the dorsum to a position low in the mouth.
place,dorsal,front,is it something
place,dorsal,back, [+back] segments are produced with the tongue dorsum bunched and retracted slightly to the back of the mouth. [-back] segments are bunched and extended slightly forward.
place,pharyngeal,pharyngeal,Pharyngeal sounds are articulated with the root of the tongue. These include epiglottal consonants.
place,glottal,glottal,Purely glottal sounds do not involve the tongue at all. These are the glottal consonants.
